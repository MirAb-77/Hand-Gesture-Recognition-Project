# üåê **Web Interfaces for Hand Gesture Recognition**

Explore the web pages created for the **Hand Gesture Recognition** project using three popular frameworks: **Streamlit**, **Flask**, and **Dash**. Each framework provides a unique approach to deploying your model and offering an interactive user experience.

## üöÄ **Project Overview**

This project includes three web interfaces, each built with a different technology stack, to demonstrate the versatility of deploying machine learning models:

### 1. **Streamlit**

**Streamlit** is a powerful framework for quickly creating interactive web applications for machine learning and data science projects.

- **Key Features**:
  - Easy to use with minimal code.
  - Real-time updates and interactive widgets.
  - Ideal for creating data-centric apps with simple UI requirements.

- **Web Page**:
  - **URL**: [Streamlit Hand Gesture Classifier](#)
  - **Functionality**: Allows users to upload a grayscale image and get immediate gesture classification results.

### 2. **Flask**

**Flask** is a lightweight web framework for Python that is flexible and easy to extend.

- **Key Features**:
  - Great for creating RESTful APIs and web services.
  - Flexible architecture for complex web applications.
  - Integrates well with other libraries and technologies.

- **Web Page**:
  - **URL**: [Flask Hand Gesture Classifier](#)
  - **Functionality**: Provides a form for image upload and displays the classification result after processing the image on the server.

### 3. **Dash**

**Dash** is a web framework for building analytical web applications. It's built on top of Flask and Plotly, making it ideal for interactive visualizations.

- **Key Features**:
  - Combines interactive UI elements with analytical capabilities.
  - Built-in support for Plotly graphs and data visualizations.
  - Suitable for creating complex dashboards and data-driven apps.

- **Web Page**:
  - **URL**: [Dash Hand Gesture Classifier](#)
  - **Functionality**: Offers a dashboard interface where users can upload images and visualize predictions along with other analytical insights.

## üìú **How to Use**

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the code and resources from this repository.
2. **Set Up Environment**: Install the necessary dependencies for each framework.
3. **Run the Applications**:
   - **Streamlit**: Run the Streamlit app with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
   - **Flask**: Start the Flask server with `python flask_app.py`.
   - **Dash**: Launch the Dash app with `python dash_app.py`.
4. **Interact**: Use the web interfaces to upload images and view gesture classification results.
